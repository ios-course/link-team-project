# JourneySquad

## Description

This is iOS application. JourneySquad is an application that allows groups of travelers to share expenses and keep track of their spending during their trip. 
With JourneySquad, users can easily create a group for trip and add other users to it. 
Each user can then add expenses they have incurred, such as meals, transportation, or hotels and appartments, and the app will automatically calculate each user's share of the total cost.
